## Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach (Raymer)

## Aircraft Structures (Peery)
[PDF 2nd Edition](https://cdn-cms.f-static.com/uploads/87049/normal_5852bea9ee723.pdf)

Excellent reference for analyzing an aircraft that goes from loads development to writing margins. Pick up a copy of the 1st Edition on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Aircraft-Structures-Dover-Aeronautical-Engineering/dp/0486485803). They have a reprint of the 1st edition for about $25. The second edition can found for even cheaper used, but it's not worth it; it's a stripped down version that drops good material from the 1st edition.
